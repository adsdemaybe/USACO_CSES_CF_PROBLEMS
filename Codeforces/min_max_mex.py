# given n: length of the array
# given k: number of divisions to make
# given a: array of n integers
# divide the array into k parts, and identify the MEX of each part where MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array
# find the maximum of all possible minimum MEXes
# 6 2
# [0]: 1 [0 1 1 2 2]: 3 // Therefore, the answer is 1

# 5 2
# 0 2 3 4 5 -> 1 

# return the smallest number not present
